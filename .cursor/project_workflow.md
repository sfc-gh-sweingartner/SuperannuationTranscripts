## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- **Commenting**: Every function and major code block must have clear comments
- **Error Handling**: All external service calls must include error handling
- **Testing**: Test each component in isolation before integration
- **Documentation**: Update documentation as features are implemented
- **Version Control**: Commit frequently with descriptive messages

### Demo-Specific Considerations
- **Predictability**: Demo scenarios must work consistently
- **Performance**: Optimize for demo speed over production efficiency
- **Fallbacks**: Have backup plans for every critical demo component
- **Simplicity**: Keep complexity hidden from demo audience
- **Reliability**: Test thoroughly in demo environment before presentation

### Technical Debt Management
- **Shortcuts**: Document all shortcuts taken for future reference
- **TODOs**: Track technical debt items for potential future improvement
- **Documentation**: Explain why shortcuts were taken and alternatives considered
- **Maintenance**: Plan for ongoing maintenance if demo becomes permanent

## Project Management Approach

### Daily Workflow
1. **Morning**: Review TODO list and prioritize tasks
2. **Development**: Focus on single task completion
3. **Testing**: Test each component as it's built
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation and comments
5. **Commit**: Commit code with clear messages
6. **Review**: Update TODO list for next day

### Issue Resolution Process
1. **Identify**: Clearly define the problem
2. **Research**: Check documentation and existing solutions
3. **Options**: Consider multiple approaches
4. **Implement**: Choose simplest solution that works
5. **Test**: Verify solution works in both environments
6. **Document**: Record solution for future reference

### Quality Checkpoints
- **Daily**: Basic functionality testing
- **Phase End**: Comprehensive testing in both environments
- **Pre-Demo**: Full end-to-end demo run-through
- **Post-Demo**: Collect feedback and document improvements

## Git Repository Management

### Branch Strategy
- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/***: Individual feature development
- **hotfix/***: Quick fixes for demo issues

### Commit Guidelines
- **Format**: `[component] description`
- **Examples**:
  - `[data] Add customer table creation script`
  - `[ui] Implement advisor view dashboard`
  - `[ai] Add error handling for Cortex AI calls`
  - `[demo] Create scenario for high churn customer`

### Release Management
- **Tag**: Each demo-ready version
- **Documentation**: Update README with deployment instructions
- **Backup**: Keep stable version for demo day
- **Recovery**: Plan for quick rollback if needed

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **AI Service Failures**: Pre-process data as backup
- **Connection Issues**: Test both environments regularly
- **Performance Problems**: Monitor query execution times
- **Data Quality**: Validate data integrity regularly

### Demo Risks
- **Audience Questions**: Prepare for common questions
- **Technical Difficulties**: Have backup scenarios ready
- **Time Constraints**: Practice timing for each section
- **Environment Issues**: Test in actual demo environment

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing in demo environment
- **Backup Plans**: Alternative flows for each demo section
